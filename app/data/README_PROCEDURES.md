# Test Question Loading Procedure

This document defines how we add or update tests from pasted study material. You can say: "Follow the Test Question Loading Procedure to create/update category X/subcategory Y from the following content." I will extract questions, answers, and explanations, then format JSON and update counts.

## Directory Structure

- `categories/<Category>/<Subcategory>/questions.json`
- `data/index.json` (auto-generated by `tools/scan.js`)

Examples:
- `categories/Computer Science/Network Protocols/questions.json`
- `categories/Finance/Accounting Basics/questions.json`

## Question JSON Schema

Each `questions.json` contains an array of question objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "q-unique-id",
    "question": "Question text here",
    "choices": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Optional explanation.",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  }
]
```

- `id` should be stable and unique within the subcategory. Use a short slug or incremental id.
- `choices` is an array of strings (2+ options). Multiple choice only.
- `answerIndex` is the 0-based index into `choices` representing the correct answer.
- `explanation` is optional; include when available.
- `difficulty` is optional; accepted values: `easy`, `medium`, `hard`.

## Creating a New Category/Subcategory

1. Create directory: `categories/<Category>/<Subcategory>/`
2. Create or overwrite `questions.json` with extracted questions in the schema above.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   node tools/scan.js
   ```
4. Verify `data/index.json` reflects the new counts.

## Updating an Existing Subcategory

1. Read existing `questions.json`.
2. Append new questions at the end (preserve existing IDs; ensure new IDs are unique).
3. Keep consistent formatting; avoid duplicates.
4. Run `node tools/scan.js` to refresh counts.

## Scanner Behavior (`tools/scan.js`)

- Recursively scans `categories/` for any `questions.json` at `<Category>/<Subcategory>/questions.json`.
- Counts valid questions and writes `data/index.json` with the structure:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "Category": {
      "Subcategory": { "count": 12 }
    }
  },
  "generatedAt": "2025-10-30T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- Invalid files are ignored with a warning (missing array, missing fields, or malformed JSON).

## Frontend Expectations

- The UI loads `data/index.json` to list categories and subcategories with counts.
- When a user selects a subcategory, the UI loads that subcategory's `questions.json` and shows:
  - Progress bar (number of questions known from index and current position)
  - Running score (correct/incorrect and percentage so far)
  - Immediate feedback with optional explanation

## Example Command Summary

- Regenerate index: `node app/tools/scan.js`
- Start local server: `node app/server.js` then open `http://localhost:8080`

## Notes

- Keep naming consistent. Capitalization in directory names is used as displayed labels.
- If you provide raw study text, I will derive Q/A/choices/explanations and produce the JSON for you.

## ChatGPT-Assisted JSON Generation

If you prefer using ChatGPT to convert text to JSON format:

1. Open `http://localhost:8080/public/import.html`
2. Click **"ðŸ’¬ Get ChatGPT Prompt"** button
3. Paste your study material in the textarea provided
4. The prompt preview will automatically update with your content inserted
5. Click **"ðŸ“‹ Copy Full Prompt"** to copy the complete prompt (including your content) to clipboard
6. Click **"Open ChatGPT â†’"** or open ChatGPT manually in another tab
7. Paste the complete prompt into ChatGPT
8. ChatGPT will generate a JSON array in the required format
9. Copy the JSON from ChatGPT's response
10. Paste it into the "Questions JSON Array" textarea on the import page
11. Fill in Category and Subcategory fields
12. Click "Import" to save the questions

**Benefits**:
- No manual JSON formatting required
- ChatGPT handles question generation, explanations, and difficulty assignment
- Fast conversion from text to ready-to-import JSON
- The prompt is pre-configured with all schema requirements

## Post-processing Cleanup

After I complete importing or generating questions and refresh the index:

- I will clear the `Category`, `Subcategory`, and the pasted content block in `INTAKE_TEMPLATE.md` (or the copied intake file you provided) so itâ€™s clean for the next run.
- I will leave your constraints/checklist structure intact.
